This GitHub repository contains MATLAB and Simulink utilities and templates to get started developing algorithms for the RoboCup Virtual Robot Manipulation Challenge. The templates include how to control the simulated robot in Gazebo using ROS and how to obtain data from the available robot sensors to be used in perception algorithms.

This GitHub repository also contains e-certificates for finalists of the challenge who have demonstrated outstanding robotics development skills by completing and submitting successful entries.

The 2024 RoboCup Virtual Manipulation Challenge will be open for registration after February 2024. For more information [visit the challenge website](https://arm.robocup.org/) and [sign up to get updates](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScA6JcHRV1qmh_-VWikgCfj62jg-GcQYgQsk6iYd8wBoeDpEg/viewform).

# Instructions for Installing and Opening Virtual Environments
1. Follow [instructions here (Appendix A) to install VM image or setup Docker container](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rVBmJmEFjujB9l4rMBZvZn50rprETTFg/view?usp=drive_link), using the archive from the step above
2. Open a command line terminal and navigate to `~/src/arm_gazebo/docker`
3. execute the the run script (`./run.bash`)

> [!NOTE]
> For MAC and Linux users: You might have to change the network bridging options in the Virtual Machine. Refer to this post: [Cannot connect to ROS master running on virtual machine](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/392422-cannot-connect-to-ros-master-running-on-virtual-machine)
